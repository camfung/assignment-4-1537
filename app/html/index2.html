                            The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis),
                             also known as the North American brown bear or 
                             simply grizzly, is a population or subspecies 
                             of the brown bear inhabiting North America.
                            In addition to the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos horribilis), other morphological 
                            forms of brown bear in North America are sometimes identified as grizzly bears.

                            The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous 
                            bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic 
                            Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding 
                            seas and surrounding land masses. It is the largest extant 
                            bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore.

                            The American black bear (Ursus americanus),
                            or simply black bear, is a medium-sized bear

                            smallest and most widely distributed bear species. 
                            American black bears are omnivores, with their 
                            diets varying greatly depending on season and location.

                            characterised by its bold black-and-white coat
                            and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes
                            used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring 
                            musteloid.
